<br>
<i> Eloheh was founded by 5 Purdue Students in 2016 who moved to Indiana for school.</i>
<br>
<i> The students had bonded over the fact they had all moved from the west coast and the injustices they had seen within the healthcare community in their counties</i>
<br>
<i> From this, the students partnered with medical professionals to address these issues. Eloheh was created to fix the heathcare gap and provide affordable care to underserved communities. The founders launched Eloheh to create quality universal healthcare.</i>
